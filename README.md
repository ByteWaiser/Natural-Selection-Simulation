# Natural-Selection-Simulation
This is my favorite project I have ever worked.

I used genetic algorithms to create an environment like human work.
But normally genetic algorithms is used to find a solution like a path to follow or like TSP problems.
In this I tweaked a little to not achieve a goal but to generate infinitely.
It has two different genders.
Both genders only attracted to the other gender.

# Most important part (Please read)
I called blue nodes man and red nodes woman.
How dark their color specifies how strong they are. In other word how big their fitness value are.
The darker the are more beautiful the will be.
For both genders only the beautiful ones attarct to beautiful ones and less beautiful to less beautiful.
Their attarction value can be %5 less beautiful and %10 more beautiful to other gender.
I did it so to make environment want to create more and more beautiful nodes.

But there is a catch. The more beautiful nodes get less fertile they will be.
I did not know what to do with this environment so I dropped here.

You can run and see if nodes(humans) wants to be more beautiful (even if I hard coded that)
or do they want to be more fertile and make environment live longer.

# Some controls
Press space to stop simulation.
Press d to see a debug menu like menu.

# Usage on your own
 Just download and open it in a browser it should work.
 
# Side Notes
It uses p5.js and P5 has a lot of compability for other languages.
If you want to use it on Python just download p5 library and look at the code and change it to python.
If you read the most important part I did not have any good idea to make this good environment etc.
If you have any idea that will improve just reach me or fork it and send pull requests I will be glad to see that.
